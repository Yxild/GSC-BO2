## What is a GSC?
In Call of Duty, there is this Scripting Language called "Game Script Code" or just GSC, It's mainly used in the Call of Duty Engines (Referring to IW's Engine). There is many variations of GSC; It's sort of like C++ but just a bit dumbed down!

GSC is super easy, I don't really need to go in-depth about this haha
